# Inventory Manager Documentation

## Overview
Inventory Manager is a professional React web application for managing inventory items. It features:
- Add, edit, delete, and search items
- AI-powered status suggestion
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Responsive Material UI design

---

## Features

### 1. Add/Edit/Delete Items
- Add new items with name, quantity, category, description, and status.
- Edit existing items in a modal dialog.
- Delete items from the table.

### 2. Search
- Search items by name, category, or status using the search bar.


### 3. AI Status Suggestion
- Status is auto-suggested based on item name and quantity:
  - If quantity is 0: `DISCONTINUED`
  - If name contains "order": `ORDERED`
  - If quantity â‰¤ 5: `LOW_STOCK`
  - If quantity â‰¥ 20: `IN_STOCK`
  - Otherwise: `IN_STOCK`

### 4. Smart AI Description Generator
- When you type a name or category (and description is empty), a meaningful description is auto-filled:
  - Template: "This is a high-quality [name] item categorized under [category]. Perfect for modern inventory needs."
- Works for both add and edit forms
- Does not overwrite if you type your own description
- Shows a "ðŸ’¡ Auto-filled by AI" hint when active

### 5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Two roles: `admin` and `viewer`
- Role is stored in localStorage and can be switched via dropdown
- `admin`: full access (add, edit, delete)
- `viewer`: can only view/search items; all form inputs and action buttons are disabled
- Role is exposed via React Context and shown as a badge at the top

### 6. Input Validation
- Name field: only letters and spaces allowed
- Quantity field: only numbers allowed
- Error messages shown for invalid input
