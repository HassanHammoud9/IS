### AI Logic

The app includes an AI-powered status suggestion:
- When you type an item's **name** or **quantity**, the app predicts the appropriate inventory status:
  - `Quantity = 0` â†’ Status: `DISCONTINUED`
  - `Quantity â‰¤ 5` â†’ Status: `LOW_STOCK`
  - If name contains "order" â†’ Status: `ORDERED`
- The prediction is applied automatically, but you can override it before submitting.

### Customization & Future Improvements
- Upgrade AI logic to use ChatGPT or other APIs
- Add authentication and user roles
- Export/import inventory data
